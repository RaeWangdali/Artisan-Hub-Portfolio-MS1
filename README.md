Artisan Hub Portfolio

This is the HTML and CSS template for the Artisan Hub portfolio project, a personal website designed to showcase an artisan's skills, projects, and contact information. This project serves as a foundational milestone for future development, with plans to integrate JavaScript for functionality and Bootstrap for a more advanced design.



Project Structure

The project is organized into a clean and logical file structure to facilitate development and collaboration.

index.html: The main HTML file containing the content and structure of the website.



images/: A directory for all project-related images. Placeholders are used for profile and project images.



styles/: A directory containing the style.css file, which holds all the styling rules for the website.



scripts/: An empty directory that will house JavaScript files for future functionality (Milestone 2).



How to Run the Project

Clone the Repository: If this project is in a GitHub repository, clone it to your local machine using git clone \[repository\_url].



Open the File: Navigate to the project folder and open index.html in your web browser. You can simply double-click the file.



Explore: The website should now be running in your browser, and you can see the HTML and CSS template in action.



Technical Considerations

HTML: The website is built using semantic HTML5 elements to ensure accessibility and clear structure. Comments are used throughout the code to explain each section.



CSS: The styling is handled by a single style.css file. It includes a CSS reset to normalize browser styles and uses a responsive design approach with media queries to adapt to different screen sizes.



Future Integration: Placeholders and comments are included in the HTML and CSS to indicate where future JavaScript and Bootstrap code will be integrated. For example, a JavaScript file will be created to handle the contact form submission, and Bootstrap will be used to streamline styling and components.
